To remove a Git branch in Git, you have a few options depending on whether you want to delete a local branch or a remote branch.

1. Delete a Local Branch:

To delete a local branch in Git, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git branch -d branch_name
Replace branch_name with the name of the branch you want to delete. The -d flag stands for "delete." This command will delete the branch if it has been fully merged into the current branch. If the branch has not been merged, Git will show a warning. If you are sure you want to delete it, use -D instead of -d to force the deletion:

bash
Copy code
git branch -D branch_name
2. Delete a Remote Branch:

To delete a remote branch in Git, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
git push --delete remote_name branch_name
Replace remote_name with the name of the remote repository (e.g., origin) and branch_name with the name of the branch you want to delete. This will remove the branch from the remote repository.

If you want to delete both the local and remote branches in one step, you can use the following command:
